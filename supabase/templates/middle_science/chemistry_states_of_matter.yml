Title: States of Matter Investigation Template
Subject: Middle School Science
Level: Difficulty

overview: >
  This investigation allows students to explore the states of matter: solid,
  liquid, gas, and plasma. Students will engage in hands-on experiments and
  observations.

levels:
  BELOW:
    description: Simple tasks like identifying states of matter in everyday items.
    questions:
      - What are examples of solids, liquids, and gases?
      - How can you tell a solid from a liquid?

  STANDARD:
    description: Conducting simple experiments to observe changes in states of matter.
    activities:
      - Melting ice to observe the transition from solid to liquid.
      - Boiling water to observe the transition from liquid to gas.
    questions:
      - What causes a solid to turn into a liquid?
      - Can you explain what happens to the water molecules during boiling?

  ADVANCED:
    description: Complex tasks requiring hypothesis development and experimental design.
    activities:
      - Investigating how temperature affects the state of matter.
      - Using a pressure chamber to explore gas behavior under different conditions.
    questions:
      - How does pressure influence the state of matter?
      - Can you predict what will happen if you increase the temperature significantly?

materials:
  - Water
  - Ice
  - Heat source
  - Pressure chamber (for advanced level)

assessment:
  - Observation of experiments
  - Student responses to questions

extensions:
  - Explore other states of matter or concepts such as plasma or colloids.
  - Discussion on real-world applications of states of matter in different industries.
