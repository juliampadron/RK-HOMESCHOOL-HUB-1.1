Title: States of Matter Investigation Template
Subject: Middle School Science
Level: Difficulty

---

## Overview
This investigation allows students to explore the states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Students will engage in hands-on experiments and observations.

### Difficulty Levels
1. **BELOW**
   - Simple tasks like identifying states of matter in everyday items.
   - Questions for students: 
     - What are examples of solids, liquids, and gases?
     - How can you tell a solid from a liquid?

2. **STANDARD**
   - Includes conducting simple experiments to observe changes in states of matter.
   - Activities: 
     - Melting ice to observe the transition from solid to liquid.
     - Boiling water to observe the transition from liquid to gas.
   - Questions for students:
     - What causes a solid to turn into a liquid?
     - Can you explain what happens to the water molecules during boiling?

3. **ADVANCED**
   - More complex tasks requiring hypothesis development and experimental design.
   - Activities: 
     - Investigating how temperature affects the state of matter.
     - Using a pressure chamber to explore gas behavior under different conditions.
   - Questions for students:
     - How does pressure influence the state of matter?
     - Can you predict what will happen if you increase the temperature significantly?

### Materials Needed
- Water
- Ice
- Heat source
- Pressure chamber (for advanced level)

### Assessment
- Observation of experiments
- Student responses to questions

### Extensions
- Explore other states of matter or concepts such as plasma or colloids.
- Discussion on real-world applications of states of matter in different industries.
