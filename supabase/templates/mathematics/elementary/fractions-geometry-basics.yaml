          A **fraction** shows part of a whole.
          The **bottom number** tells how many equal parts there are.
          The **top number** tells how many parts we are talking about.

          **Fraction equivalence**: a/b = (n×a)/(n×b) — multiplying numerator and denominator by the same number gives an equivalent fraction.
          **Geometric attributes**: Shapes can be categorized by attributes (number of sides, parallel sides, right angles, equal sides).
          **Hierarchy of shapes**: A square is always a rectangle, but a rectangle is not always a square.

          A pizza is cut into equal slices. The whole pizza is a circle.
          If you cut it into 6 equal slices, what fraction does each slice represent?
          Each slice is a triangle-like shape called a **sector**.
          How many sectors would you need to make 1/2 of the pizza? 2/3?
          Draw a model and write equations to support your answer.

          **For Parents:** Deepen fraction understanding with cooking — measuring 1/2 cup, 3/4 cup, etc. For geometry, explore tessellations (tiling patterns) and ask which shapes tile perfectly and why.
