          **For Parents:** Talk about everyday forces! How many pushes and pulls can you find around your home?

          A **PUSH** moves something AWAY from you.
          A **PULL** brings something CLOSER to you.
          Both pushes and pulls are **forces**.

        steps:

          **For Parents:** Talk about friction! Smooth surfaces have less friction than rough surfaces. That's why the toy moved differently!

          **Forces** are pushes and pulls that make things move or change shape.
          **Friction** is a force that slows things down or stops movement.
          **Gravity** is a force that pulls things toward Earth.

        steps:
          - "Choose an object to push (toy car, ball, etc.)"
          - "Make a prediction: On which surface will the object slide farthest?"
          - "Test on 3 different surfaces: carpet, hardwood, tile"
          - "Measure the distance traveled each time"
          - "Repeat 3 times on each surface"

          **For Parents:** Challenge your child to predict and test! "What surfaces in our home have high friction? Low friction?" This builds scientific thinking.
