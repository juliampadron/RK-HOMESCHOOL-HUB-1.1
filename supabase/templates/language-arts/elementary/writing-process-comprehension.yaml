          - A **closing sentence** that wraps up the paragraph

        passage: |
          Honeybees are amazing insects. They live together in large groups called colonies. 
          Each bee has a special job. Worker bees collect nectar from flowers to make honey. 
          The queen bee lays eggs to keep the colony growing. Without bees, many plants 
          could not make seeds. Bees help flowers and crops grow by spreading pollen.
        questions:
          - "What do worker bees do? ___________________________"
          - "Why are bees important to plants? ___________________________"
          - "What is the job of the queen bee? ___________________________"

          **For Parents:** After reading the passage together, ask your child: "What is the most interesting fact you learned?" Encourage them to summarize in their own words.

        passage: |
          Water is one of the most important resources on Earth. It covers about 71% of 
          the planet's surface, yet only about 3% of all water is fresh water that people 
          can drink. Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, and underground. When it rains, 
          water soaks into the ground or flows into rivers and streams. This water cycle 
          keeps water moving around our planet. However, pollution and overuse threaten 
          our water supply. Scientists and communities work together to protect clean water 
          for future generations.
        questions:
          - "What percentage of Earth's water is fresh water? ___________________________"
          - "Name two places where fresh water is found. ___________________________"
          - "According to the passage, what threatens our water supply? ___________________________"
          - "Why do you think protecting clean water is important? Use evidence from the text and your own ideas."
