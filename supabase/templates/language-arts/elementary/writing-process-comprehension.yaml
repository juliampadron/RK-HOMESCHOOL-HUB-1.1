          Every year, thousands of monarch butterflies make an incredible journey.
          They travel up to 3,000 miles from Canada and the United States to their winter home in Mexico.
          Scientists call this a migration. The butterflies navigate using the sun and Earth's magnetic field.
          When spring arrives, the butterflies begin the long journey north again.
          Scientists are still learning how such a small insect can travel so far. Many people work to
          protect the butterflies' habitat so this amazing migration can continue for future generations.

          The ocean covers more than 70 percent of Earth's surface, yet scientists estimate that
          more than 80 percent of it remains unexplored. Every year, researchers discover new species
          living in the deep sea—creatures adapted to crushing pressure, total darkness, and near-freezing
          temperatures. Some scientists argue that exploring the deep ocean is as important as exploring space,
          because the answers to questions about life, climate, and even medicine may lie hidden beneath the waves.
          Others caution that deep-sea exploration must be done carefully to avoid disturbing fragile ecosystems
          that took millions of years to develop. As technology improves, the debate over how—and how much—to
          explore the deep ocean continues to grow.
